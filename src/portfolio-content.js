      text: "I designed, modeled, and fabricated a 3D printed puzzle box with mechanical puzzles embedded into a transforming geometrical form. This was my final thesis project for the Bachelor of Interaction Design program at Sheridan. The end result was a 3D printed mechanical puzzle sphere (only loosely called a puzzle box), with twelve uniquely solvable rotating ring puzzles embedded on the faces of a dodecahedron. The project acted as an exploration of studio practice, digital fabrication, puzzle design, play-testing, and algorithmic generation. The driving force behind it was my personal passion for puzzles and fascination with mixing the digital with the physical. The process started in two intertwined areas: puzzles and geometry. In order to create something that mixed digital and physical, I had to discover a physical form that worked well with a particular type of puzzle, and vice-versa. From there it went through testing, iteration, reiteration, retesting, more reiteration and testing, and finally fabrication. Over the course of the project I encountered a ton of challenges and a handful of eureka moments that Iâ€™m going to go over here.",

I used paper prototypes and recruited a variety of players to test out possible puzzle types. Some players came back to help test multiple iterations, and others were new to the project, only trying a single version. The main things I was looking for in a puzzle was that the rules can be learned without guidance or supervision, and that I could conceive of a way to make the puzzle in physical form. After creating and testing several different puzzle types, I landed on a rotating rings puzzle that worked well with the physical forms I was considering. This type of puzzle had a number of benefits:",
