During my internship at Autodesk I was tasked with designing and building an image generator that was used to create images for Autodesk’s internal design conference, X Summit.

X Summit Generator is an interactive web app that generates unique, cohesive images using p5.js. The images were used as slide backgrounds for presentations, as well as in the signage and branding of the event.

It’s live online, at [xsummitgenerator.autodesk.com](http://xsummitgenerator.autodesk.com), if you want to generate some images.

- Make the generator accessible and easy to use for presenters and organizers`,

* global and relative scale of elements
* subset of colour scheme used
* faux 3d shading
* distribution of elements
* special structures (stacks and florets)
* internal knockouts and cutouts
* rotation of triangles

Almost every aspect of the generator is subject to some randomization, enabling it to generate novel images that still share a visual language.
